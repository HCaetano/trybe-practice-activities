## All the code created for the course's daily activities is available here

### Module 1 - Command line and Shell script

  Learned some basic command line commands, such as ```mkdir```, ```mv```, ```rm```, ```cp```, ```cat```, among others. Also learned the basics of Shell script: read input from the command line, process said input and print a return on the terminal.
